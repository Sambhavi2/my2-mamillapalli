###### One of my favorite vacation spot is Niagara Falls
Niagara Falls is an **amazing waterfall** on the border of the US and Canada. It's famous for its big, powerful cascades and the mist that sprays up. Lots of people come to see it and take boat rides to get closer. It's a really **cool place** to visit!
